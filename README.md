# Pokedex
Files/Database Systems Pokedex Project
This project is made in partial fulfillment of CS317 Files/Database Systems Fall 2015
We do not own any part of Pokemon, use of it is mainly a proof of concept to implement a relational 
database. All sprites/relevant data was pulled from official pokemon databases online
